          <h3>For patients with myoclonus-dystonia</h3>
          <p>We want to create a global registry of patients with myoclonus-dystonia (MD) so that we can identify those who would be willing to be approached about taking part in future research projects on MD. It will also allow us to have a better idea of how many people have MD within the United Kingdom and eventually globally.

        <h3>For patients with dystonia</h3>
        
        <p>
          We are trying to understand the complete spectrum of symptoms that individuals with forms of primary Dystonia experience and how this impacts on day-to-day living. By comparing information from people with forms of primary Dystonia with people who have Myoclonus Dystonia and healthy controls, we hope that our study will improve the understanding of Dystoniaâ€™s and help find better treatments in the future.

   <p>
   Further assessment of non-motor symptoms (such as anxiety, depression, pain, sleep problems) experienced by people with MD will allow us to understand the complete range of symptoms that individuals with Myoclonus Dystonia, experience and how this impacts on day-to-day living. By comparing information from people with Myoclonus Dystonia with information from people with other forms of dystonia or those who do not have any dystonia symptoms, we hope that our study will improve the understanding of Myoclonus Dystonia and help find better treatments in the future.
